Supplementary examples and functions for Ruetenik, G.A., Jansen, J.D., Val, P., and Yl√§-Mella, L., "Optimising global landscape evolution models with 10Be"

The global optimisation can be run via the montecarlo.py script, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For real applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):
