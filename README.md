# lem_optimize
This code performs a monte-carlo based iterative search for optimal landscape evolution parameters among a global (or select) set of drainage basins.

The global optimisation can be run via the montecarlo.py script, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

The octopus data is found here - this is only to be used for the examples.  For new applications users should download the latest version from the OCTOPUS website ( https://octopusdata.org/ ):
